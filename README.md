# Dungeon Core Idle

## Overview
Dungeon Core Idle is a text-based incremental game where you play as a newly formed dungeon core. Absorb mana, develop your dungeon, research new abilities, and evolve your core to become the most powerful dungeon in existence.

Inspired by dungeon core literature like Divine Dungeon and Blue Core, this game lets you experience the journey from a simple stone core to a complex, sentient dungeon entity.

## Core Features

### Mana Absorption
- Click to manually absorb ambient mana
- Develop features that passively generate mana
- Research enhancements to increase mana generation

### Dungeon Evolution
- Start as a simple Stone Core
- Evolve through multiple tiers: Crystal → Gem → Elemental → Sentient
- Each evolution resets certain elements but provides powerful bonuses

### Research System
- Unlock research paths representing different dungeon specializations
- Discover new dungeon features, abilities, and optimizations
- Make strategic choices that affect your gameplay style

### Growth Mechanics
- Expand your dungeon's size and influence
- Attract adventurers who provide valuable essence
- Balance expansion with defensive capabilities

## Game Progression

The game transitions from active clicking in early stages to a more strategic idle experience:

1. **Early Game**: Manual clicking focus with basic passive generators
2. **Mid Game**: Hybrid gameplay with strategic research decisions
3. **Late Game**: Complex management of an automated dungeon ecosystem

## How to Play

1. Click the core to generate initial mana
2. Spend mana to create basic dungeon features
3. Research abilities to improve mana generation
4. Expand your dungeon size to place more features
5. Evolve your core when you reach evolution thresholds
6. Repeat with powerful bonuses after each evolution

## Development Status

Dungeon Core Idle is currently in development. See the ImplementationPlan.md file for details on the development roadmap.
