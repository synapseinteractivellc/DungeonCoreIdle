## Current Priority List üéØ

### High Priority (Next 2 weeks)
1. **Skills System Implementation** - The only major system still missing
2. **Evolution/Prestige System** - Core progression mechanic
3. **Adventurer System** - Content expansion
4. **Settings Menu** - Quality of life

### Medium Priority (Following 2-4 weeks)
1. **Achievements System** - Player engagement
2. **Special Events** - Content variety
3. **Balance Testing** - Game polish
4. **Performance Optimization** - Technical debt

### Low Priority (Future iterations)
1. **Advanced Features** - Feature synergies, templates
2. **Mobile Optimization** - Platform expansion
3. **Multiplayer Features** - Social elements

## Progress Summary
- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ 100% Complete
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ ~85% Complete (Skills system missing)
- **Phase 3**: üîÑ ~25% Complete (Evolution and Adventurer systems needed)
- **Phase 4**: ‚úÖ ~90% Complete (Settings menu pending)
- **Phase 5**: üîÑ ~30% Complete (Testing ongoing)

The game has a solid foundation with most core systems implemented. The main missing pieces are the Skills system, Evolution/Prestige mechanics, and the Adventurer system. The research and dungeon expansion systems are fully functional, and the UI is polished with good user experience features.
